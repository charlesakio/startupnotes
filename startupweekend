For the past 3 days, I have learned tremendously about startups. Taking the idea to product.
Here are is a list of the things that I have learned.

1.) Know and understand your customers, without having a grasp of the people your serving how would you know what they like and dont like? Their wants and needs? Pains and problems. 

2.) Validate your assumptions, no matter how good your idea looks validate it to see if your right.

with honest feedback, sometimes people will give you feedbacks that you want to hear. Find out what they really think deepdown about the solutions that you are offering.

3.) Teammates are important, without a great team around you their wont be any company. 

4.) Design, Build, Test, Collect, Repeat, This process is iterative. The feedback from users will help you understand to build a great product.

5.) Everyone needs to be heard, someone might have a better idea than yours. Be willing to listen to peoples ideas.

6.) People see, think, speak differently. Knowing ther pattern of behaviour would help you communicate with them.

7.) Data driven decision, always get your facts right before making decisions.

8.) Problem to Solution. Keep it simple to show the problem and offer a solution. 

9.) Focus on the customers and everything else will follow.

10.) Eliminate the noise from the signal. Everyday, we are constanly bombarded with distractions. 
What sperates people are the ones who can focus on their goals.

11.) Contranian truth by Peter Thiel.
